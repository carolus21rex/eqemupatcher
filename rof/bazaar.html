<c "#ffff00"> 3.12 The Bazaar </c>
<br><br>
The Bazaar is a place where characters can sell their items to other characters. You can become a merchant and sell your wares, or simply browse the items others have for sale.
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">Browsing and Buying</c>
<br>
To find what you want in the Bazaar, type /bazaar. This opens the Bazaar Search Window. On the left you will see a place to type in the name or partial name of the item you are looking for. Beneath that are several selection options to help you narrow down your search.
<br><br>
When you find an item you're interested in select it in the window. If you want to find the person selling that item, simply click the Find Trader button. This will show you a path to that merchant. Once you find the merchant, just right-click him or her to open their merchant window and buy what you want!
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">Becoming a Merchant</c>
<br>
To become a merchant you will need to purchase one or more Trader's Satchel from Merchant Tekrama in the bazaar. Any item you wish to sell will have to be placed in a Trader's Satchel. Place the items you want to sell into the satchel, move your character to one of the wooden bazaar platforms. Then type /trader to open the Bazaar Vendor window.
<br><br>
Use the Set Price button to set the prices for your items. Even for stacked items, you are setting the price for ONE of those items. Once you have all of your prices set, click the Begin Trader button and you will become a merchant.
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE: </c> When starting out it is probably best to sell small, cheap items until you get used to the system.  You should also note that Trader's Satchels are very heavy and you should be sure to leave them in your bank before leaving the Bazaar zone.
